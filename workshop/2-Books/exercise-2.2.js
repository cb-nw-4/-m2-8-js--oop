// Exercise 2.2
// ------------
// Create a BookList class that has the following properties:
//      - `books` (empty array)
//      - `lastRead` - reference to last book read (null for now)
//      - `currentlyReading` - reference to current book (null for now)
//
// Then instantiate it once as 'homeLibrary'

// Console.log(homeLibrary) to verify that all is working.

class BookList {
  constructor (name) {
      this.name = name;
      this.books = []
      this.lastRead = null;
      this.currentlyReading = null;
  }
}

let homeLibrary = new BookList('MyHomeLib');

console.log(homeLibrary);
